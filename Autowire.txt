For autowire="byType", the spring framework will find how many properties are there

1) private Interface variable; only one
	here variable is a reference type and variable is the name of variable
2) Then it will find whats the type of the property (Interface)
3) It will check if that type is a class or an interface
	if interface -> a) find classes that implement the interface
	next	     b) is there any spring bean defined for that class
For each property repeat the above steps.

For the above config, lets see autowire by construcor,

<bean id="idName" class="Type" autowire="constructor">
</bean>

autowire="constructor"
1) For a class, it wil find how many ctors are there -> for example if 2 are there
2) start with max no of args  
3) Interface variable , what is the type of variable
4) Is it a class or interface -> its interface
5) which class implements that interface , is there any bean defined for that type
   now inject that bean into the ctor.
